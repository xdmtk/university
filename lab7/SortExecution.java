   21.13 - Write a program that obtains the execution time of selection sort, bubble sort,
       merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort for input size 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, 
       250,000, and 300,000. Your program should create data randomly and print a table as 
       shown in the following sample run (note the array size should be as specified, 
       not as shown in the example)

		 *
		 *	Essentially, an arbitray pivot point is chosen, ( in this case it's
		 *	the first element of the array ) and the two search indices 'high' and 'low'
		 *	begin comparing numbers against the pivot.
		 *
		 *  The idea of quick sort is to move all elements less than the pivot number
		 *  to the left of the array, and all elements greater than the pivot to the right
		 *  of the array. 
		 *
		 *  The index at which the final swap is made, is returned by the function as the index
		 *  where the numbers greater and less than the pivot number, and is used in `myQuickSort()`
		 *  as the point in which to split the array, and perform the partition() ( again ) , on both
		 *  sides, choosing another pivot point and moving the elements left and right again, until
		 *  the subsets of the arrays become only a 2 element array which is swapped appropriately.
		 *
		 *  The subsets when put back together ( no new arrays are actually created, only the index
		 *  values are used as starting and stopping points ) , will have all of the lesser elements 
		 *  ascending from the left, and all the greater elements descending from the right.
		 *
		 *  The array is now sorted
		 *
		 *  @params
		 *		int[] list - The array to be sorted
		 *		int first - The starting index of the array
		 *		int last - The ending index of the array
