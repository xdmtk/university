Any experienced programmer engaged in writing programs for use by others knows that,
once his program is working correctly, good output is a must. Few people really care how much
time and trouble a programmer has spent in designing and debugging a program. Most people 
only see the results. Often, by the time a programmer has finished tackling a difficult problem,
any output may look great. The programmer knows what it means and how to interpret it. However,
the same cannot be said for others, or even for the programmer himself six months hence.
