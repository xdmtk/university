Computer Science 282
Programming Assignment #1

Due: September 11, 2019

You are to write a program that will implement Warnsdorff’s algorithm for finding a generalized knight’s
tour on a chessboard. This link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour provides some information
about knight tours and the algorithm I want you to use.


You must implement the two classes with the methods shown starting on the next page. Do not make any
changes to the classes, variables, names, etc. Just add code. Also, no backtracking or recursion should be
used. Part of the input data will include the legal moves that can be made by the generalized knight. For
example, for a normal knight three of the eight legal moves are (1, 2), (1, –2), and (2, 1). The test data file
test1.txt shows a typical input file for the case of a normal knight. In general you will need to input the size
of the board, the starting square for the knight, and the legal moves for the knight. Though I will sometimes
provide links to various files, all files related to this and all other programs reside in the Files area of Canvas.
There often comes a time when the algorithm provides a choice of equally good moves. In such a case
you must choose the move that comes last in the input list of legal moves.


This assignment is as much about following instructions as it is about programming. Be sure your
methods do exactly what is expected of them and all rules mentioned below and in class are followed.
What follows are general rules that you must follow for this and, as applicable, all other programs you
write in this class. Failure to follow these rules will cost you points.


1. I will eventually post a final test program. A small sample test program is already posted to help get you
started. You are to turn in a printout of your program and a printout of the output obtained from running
the final test program. Don’t wait for my final test program to appear to start debugging your program.
You should begin testing with your own test programs. Also, the final test program I post may not be the
same test program I run on your programs. You cannot assume your program is correct just because it
works on the posted test program.

2. In addition to handing in a listing of your program and a printout of your output, you must also email me
both of your java classes in a single file named prog1.java. Do not email me your output or my test
program. Be sure that my main (test) program is in a different file from your two classes. Also, do not
make your classes "public". The subject of your email should be “Alison Riske – prog 1 – 2:00” if your
name is Alison Riske and you attend the 2:00 class. Change 2:00 to 3:30 if that is the time of your class.
Your prog1.java file should be an attachment. If you deviate from any of these rules you will lose points
because doing so makes it much more difficult for me to manage and test your programs. For example, in
the email subject pay attention to what is upper case, what is lower case, the location of the hyphen, etc.


3. The top of your prog1.java file (and all java code that you turn in to me in the future) should begin with
comments that show: (i) Your name; (ii) Comp 282 and clear mention of what time your class meets; (iii)
The assignment number; (iv) The date the assignment was handed in (which is not necessarily the same
as the due date); (v) A brief description of what is contained in the file.


4. For all Java code you turn in be sure to:
    a) Choose clear and suggestive variable names.

    b) No part of your printed output should have lines wrapped to the first column of next line or
        disappearing off the end of the page.

    c) Use comments generously to describe how your methods work. Comments should appear
    inside your methods, too – not just at the top. That said, don't overdo the comments.

    d) There should be no more than one return statement in any method.

    e) Do not use break statements to exit loops.

    f) Do not use global variables. If you are not sure if you are using them, ask.

    g) Reminder: Programs should be 100% your own work, as stated in the syllabus.
