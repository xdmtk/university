            Hi there
        </p>

        <p> 
            As you can see from the heading, my name is Nicholas Martinez. I am 27 years old, currently a Junior transitioning to a Senior at CSUN. I've been
            tinkering around with computers for virtually all of my life, starting with the family Apple IIGS somewhere in the late 90's. I became interested 
            programming them circa 2003 after realizing I could cheat in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyCoke" target="_blank">favorite online game</a> 
            by modifying outgoing web traffic using a program called 'WPE Pro' (Winsock Packet Editor)
        </p>

        <p>
            Nowadays I'm a huge fan of programming retro computers including <a href="misc/commodore.jpg" target="_blank">my Commodore 64</a>, 
            <a href="https://xdmtk.org" target="_blank">graphics programming with GLSL</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/xdmtk/sim808-anti-theft" target="_blank">
            building embedded projects with AVR microcontrollers</a> (especially the ATTiny series). 
        </p>

        <p>
            During my time in university I've had the oppurtunity to work a couple years in industry, both as an intern and as a full time developer doing mostly 
            <a href="https://collide.com" target="_blank">Web Development</a> and a little bit of <a href="https://thebrain.com" target="_blank">Applications Development</a>.
            And while I enjoyed both of these experiences, my primary goal is to enter the field of embedded and kernel level development. Many of these positions won't 
            even look at a resume without a College Degree attached to it, and as a result I am here at CSUN hoping to finish up a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science by Spring 2021. 
        </p>
