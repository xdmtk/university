        Hi there
        </p>

        <p> 
        As you can see from the heading, my name is Nicholas Martinez. I am 27 years old, currently a Junior transitioning to a Senior at CSUN. I've been
        tinkering around with computers for virtually all of my life, starting with the family Apple IIGS somewhere in the late 90's. I became interested 
        programming them circa 2003 after realizing I could cheat in my favorite online game by modifying outgoing web traffic using a program called 
        'WPE Pro' (Winsock Packet Editor)
        </p>

        <p>
        Nowadays I'm a huge fan of programming retro computers including my Commodore 64, graphics programming with GLSL, and building embedded projects with 
        AVR microcontrollers (especially the ATTiny series). 
        </p>

        <p>
        During my time in university I've had the oppurtunity to work a couple years in industry, both as an intern and as a full time developer doing mostly 
        Web Development and a little bit of Applications Development. And while I enjoyed both of these experiences, my primary goal is to enter the field
        of embedded and kernel level development. Many of these positions won't even look at a resume without a College Degree attached to it, and as a result
        I am here at CSUN hoping to finish up a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science by Spring 2021.
