#! NOTE: The previous assignment was to develop code to align data elements. For this
    test, you will create an object called align and use the code you developed in the
    previous assignment for the alignment functions.

    You will turn in 3 sections of the program - one section is the creation of the object,
    the second section is the .cpp file that contains the function definition s, and
    the third section is the code to use the object and produce the following program.




    You own four warehouses across the country, each of which can stock five particular items.
    There are two types of reports that will be produced. These two choices will appear on a menu.

    The menu selections will offer the user their choice of the two reports listed below
    and create the appropriate reports.


    The Zero Stock Report prints all items and indicates any items that have a stock of zero, in 
    three or more warehouses The Less Than Ten Report indicates, by warehouse, items that have a 
    stock of less than ten.


    Please center your reports on the screen. A program that produces these exact results will
    earn a grade of 80. You can earn additional points as follows: 

            - 10 points by right justifying the numbers
            - 5 points by including a menu
            - 5 points using a menu and parameter passing
