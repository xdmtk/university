# Project 2A - Platform Simulation UI

In this project we were instructed to create a UI overlay for the Platform Simulation project we completed in Project 1. 
The specifications required us to create a configuration panel with initial conditions for the Platform constructions.
These conditions were:

    1. Input for MxN platform values
    2. Slider input for Y-Axis range
    3. Slider input for platform spacing
    4. Dropdown input for color spectrum
    5. Button to start/stop the simulation
    6. Button to show/hide the config panel
    7. Button to exit the simulation
    8. Button to build a new platform with the config values

##### What I Learned

This project mainly focused on the Unity API for GUI elements. I found it very similar to generic event based 
programming so in all honestly this assignment was fairly easy and straight forward. The most imporant things 
were understanding that GUI elements are treated very similar to regular GameObjects, of which I had already 
dealt with in the previous project.
