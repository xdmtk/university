### High Level Steps
1. Wired up the Arduino
2. Wrote the code
3. Flashed the sketch via USB 
4. Tested project

Apologies if these writeups are a bit basic, but the warmups are
fairly straightforward (as intended) and consequently don't require
a whole lot of discernible high level steps. 

### Project Completion
Project is 100% functional.
