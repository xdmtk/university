FILES:
---------

1. lab2.php
    Contains main site HTML + PHP API functions

2. lab2.js
    Contains JS for main site, including JS POST functions to call on PHP API's

3. lab2.css
    Styles for main site

4. lab2.mysql
    Database scheme + data dump



BRIEF:
---------

Project is 100% complete. Performs all described behavior in instructions

1. Login Form -> Interacts with Login API
    - Rejects logins with invalid usernames/passwords

2. Registration Form -> Interacts with Registration API
    - Rejects registrations for usernames that already exist in the DB

3. Administrator Login -> Produces a dump of the user table contents sorted alphabetically by username

4. Normal Login -> Produces a welcome message with a button that changes the background color of the site

5. Logout Link -> Returns the user back to the login/registration page
    - Destroys the PHP session set at login



EXTRA CREDIT:
---------

1. Registration stores a salted hash of the users password. Hashed using PHP's builtin `password_hash()`
function and verified using PHP's builtin 'password_verify()' function. Rejects login attempts that fail
this verification


2. The main page never refreshes nor submits to any other page. Basically all of the API's are reached through
XHR POST calls via JS event handlers. Data is returned in JSON format and handled by the JS accordingly.
