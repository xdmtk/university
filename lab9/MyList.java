            Write a test program that creates two MyArrayList s, list1 and list2 , with
            the initial values {"Tom", "George", "Peter", "Jean", "Jane"} and {"Tom", "George", "Michael", "Michelle", "Daniel"}
            then perform the following operations:
            
            ■ Recreates list1 and list2 with the same initial values, invokes
            ■ Invokes list1.addAll(list2) , and displays list1 and list2 .
                    list1.removeAll(list2) , and displays list1 and list2 .
            ■ Recreates list1 and list2 with the same initial values, invokes
                    list1.retainAll(list2) , and displays list1 and list2 .
