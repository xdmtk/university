        Exercise 24.1:


        (Add set operations in MyList ) Define the following methods in MyList and
        implement them in MyAbstractList :
            
            
            /** Adds the elements in otherList to this list.
            * Returns true if this list changed as a result of the call *
           
               public boolean addAll(MyList<E> otherList);
            
            
            /** Removes all the elements in otherList from this list
            * Returns true if this list changed as a result of the call *
                public boolean removeAll(MyList<E> otherList);
            
            
            /** Retains the elements in this list that are also in otherList
            * Returns true if this list changed as a result of the call *
                public boolean retainAll(MyList<E> otherList);
            
            
            
            Write a test program that creates two MyArrayList s, list1 and list2 , with
            the initial values {"Tom", "George", "Peter", "Jean", "Jane"} and {"Tom", "George", "Michael", "Michelle", "Daniel"}
            then perform the following operations:
            
            ■ Recreates list1 and list2 with the same initial values, invokes
            ■ Invokes list1.addAll(list2) , and displays list1 and list2 .
                    list1.removeAll(list2) , and displays list1 and list2 .
            ■ Recreates list1 and list2 with the same initial values, invokes
                    list1.retainAll(list2) , and displays list1 and list2 .
