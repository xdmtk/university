    Exercise 22.3 (Pattern Matching)
        
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter two strings
        and tests whether the second string is a substring of the first string. Suppose
        the neighboring characters in the string are distinct. (Donâ€™t use the indexOf
        method in the String class.) Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.
        Your algorithm needs to be at least O(n) time. Here is a sample run of the
        program:




*/

import java.util.Random;

public class PatternMatch  {


    public static void main(String[] args) {





    }


    public long mySubStr(String s1, String s2) {

        long startTime, endTime, execTime;
        startTime = System.nanoTime();



        endTime = System.nanoTime();
        execTime = endTime - startTime;

        return execTime;


    }








}
